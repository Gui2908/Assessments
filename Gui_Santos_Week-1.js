// 1. Look at this if statement... something about it doesn't really make sense.
// Change it so that the messages make sense.

if(true) {
  console.log("You'll never see this message!");
} else {
  console.log("This message is visible");
}

if(true) {
  console.log("This message is visible");
} else {
  console.log("You'll never see this message!");
}



// 2. Create a for loop that counts to 10 backwards. Comment each line to explain what is happening.

for(var i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {

  var result = i
console.log(result);
}




// 3. Create an array with at least 4 items inside it. Console.log the second thing in the list.
// Change the fourth item to equal "duck".

var newArr = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]; {
  console.log(newArr[1]);
  console.log(newArr[3]="duck");
}


// 4. Being comfortable with if/else decisions is very helpful in code.
// It helps you get into the practice of breaking complex actions down into their simpler parts.
// You might recognize this example:

if(!tired) {
	keepWorking()
} else {
	console.log("I need coffee!")
}

// Now try to come up with your own if/else decision - if you can't think of one,
// try to create one for opening a door.
function goToTheBeach() {
  return "I went to the beach!";
}
function didNotGoToTheBeach() {
  return "Not a beach day. Get some coding done!";
}

if(sunny = true) {
  goToTheBeach()
} else {
  didNotGoToTheBeach()
}


// 5. Time to combine all this! Create a function that takes in two numbers as arguements.
// Find the sum of those two numbers, if the sum is less than 20, console log the sum.
// If the two numbers sum to more than 20, console log "can't count that high!"

function practiceFunc(arg1, arg2) {
	// your code here
}















// space
