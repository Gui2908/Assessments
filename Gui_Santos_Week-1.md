#### 3. Explain local vs global scope in programming. Feel free to create a code example to support your answer.

  //Your Answer => Global scope is visible when you call it from anywhere. Local scope is inside of a function and need to be called by a special object that receives the value of the local scope.

  var globalScope = "I'm a global scope"
  function(myFunc) {
    var localScope = "I'm a local scope"
    var getLocalScope = localScope // CALL ME (getLocalScope) TO ACCESS MY VALUE. I'M YOUR WAY TO THE LOCAL SCOPE.
  }
